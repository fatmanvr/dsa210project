AI Art Trends: Analysis of Popularity and Style Evolution Data Science Project Report

# **Introduction (Motivation)**
The rise of AI-generated art has reshaped creative production, democratizing access while raising debates about originality and artistic value. Despite the artistic discussions, there is limited quantitative analysis of how the public engages with different AI-generated styles or tools.
By investigating measurable data such as likes and views, this project aims to bridge artistic intuition with data-driven insight, helping understand the cultural reception of AI creativity.
