AI Art Trends: Analysis of Popularity and Style Evolution Data Science Project Report

# **Introduction (Motivation)**
The rise of AI-generated art has reshaped creative production, democratizing access while raising debates about originality and artistic value. Despite the artistic discussions, there is limited quantitative analysis of how the public engages with different AI-generated styles or tools.
By investigating measurable data such as likes and views, this project aims to bridge artistic intuition with data-driven insight, helping understand the cultural reception of AI creativity.

# **Data Sources and Collection Methods**
- Public datasets from Kaggle
( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/ai-generated-art-trends
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/ai-generated-art-popularity-and-market-trends )

# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and ensured data quality.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated summary statistics for popularity metrics such as Popularity_Score, Likes, and Engagement_Score.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Numerical correlations were explored through a heatmap after applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- **Category Comparison:** Boxplots and bar charts were used to compare popularity across categorical variables such as art style, creator type, tool, and region.

### **Hypotheses**
- **H1:** Popularity has significantly increased after 2022.
- **H2:** Certain tools correlate with higher average engagement.
- **H3:** Human-edited (Hybrid) artworks perform better than fully AI-generated ones.
- **H4:** Art style significantly affects popularity.

# **Machine Learning Applications**
After applying ML methods, the outcomes will be summarized.

# **Findings and Insights**
After conducting the analysis, key insights will be summarized.

# **Limitations and Future Work**
## **Limitations**
- **Scope and Representativeness:** Dataset may not capture the full diversity of AI-generated art.
- **External Factors:** Engagement metrics like likes or views can be affected by external factors such as platform visibility or artist reputation.
- **Aesthetic Factors:** The analysis focuses on metadata rather than visual content, leaving aesthetic factors unexplored.

## **Future Work**
- Future work could include larger, multi-platform datasets and integrate image-based features such as color or composition.
- More advanced models, including ensemble or deep learning approaches, could further enhance predictive accuracy and uncover deeper cultural patterns in AI-driven art trends.

# **Conclusion**
This project will provide a data-driven understanding of how AI-generated art trends evolve and what factors contribute to public engagement. By combining aesthetic intuition with quantitative analysis, the study aims to illustrate the cultural shift in creativity brought by artificial intelligence. Beyond artistic curiosity, this research highlights how machine learning can interpret human taste and digital creativity patterns in an era where algorithms shape both creation and reception.
